KNAF has no API. Extending it is as simple as writing more
shell scripts to do what you want. Taking a look at the ones under
examples/system should be sufficient to give you an idea of
what input they need to be able to parse/what arguments they should
accept.

There is no dependency resolution present in KNAF, nor is there
a built-in ability to perform more than one pass. It is assumed that
you will implement these things yourself by wrapping it.

For primitive ordering/dependency, KNAF does execute scripts in
facts/ and decisions/ in alphanumeric order, so you can put more
fundamental stuff earlier. The full body of 'facts' will be fed
to each 'decision'. That's more informed than your typical jury.
